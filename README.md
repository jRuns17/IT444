# IT444 - Capstone project
This repository is storing my python scripts relating to my senior capstone project at JMU. In addition to my senior capstone project class,
I take part in "IT480 - Autonomous Vehicle" at the same time. This class has several teams working on different aspects of an autonomous golf cart.
My piece of this project is to utilize the ZED cameras that face the cart passengers to analyze their emotions. My team will collect data
from test runs with passengers aboard in the form of an .mp4 video file. These videos will then be run through the python scripts found here to analyze
their emotions. We are looking at how a passenger feels while they are riding in the cart autonomously (Ex. Whether or not
they are feeling happy and safe while on the ride). If they are not feeling safe, we have another ZED camera that is looking in front of the cart,
and we can also use footage from the front facing camera to see if something happened that made them feel a certain way.
